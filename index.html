                <h1>Blueberry Bliss</h1>
                <p>Swimming across the ocean was Norby's favorite thing to do! He would swim all day long until his Mom called him to come home. As he swam he snacked on blueberries. His mom would pack him a lunch but all he ate was blueberries. As he was swimming he ran into a coral reef and bumped his horn. The crash made him fall in to a deep sleep and when looking into a seashell he noticed his horn had turned blue! 
                    The blueberries he had eaten were magic and saved him when he got into his accident, now he was a blueberry Narwhal! </p>
